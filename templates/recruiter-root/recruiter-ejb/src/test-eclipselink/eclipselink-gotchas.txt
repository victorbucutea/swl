After testing eclipselink has proved the following advantages :


1. crudDao.save(cvToUpdate); crudDao.find(cvToUpdate.getId()) does not hit the DB with another select
2. CV cv = crudDao.create(createCV()); eagerly loads previously persisted entities ( refresh is cascaded properly ) 
3. crudDao.find(id) properly initializez all child entitites as being lazily initialized ( Hibernate will do a query for each child entity, and it will also lazy load only some children - the others will still be eagerly loaded.
